	<p><h2> About this Visualization </h2></p>
	<body>
	<p><h3>Structure</h3>
		<font size="2">
		The visualization employs the martini glass structure.  The first three scenes shows the data <br>
		aggregated by quarter, day of week and hour of day.  The last scene invites the viewer to <br>
		explore the data further.  Each of the first three scenes has stacked bar charts that displays <br>
		the data for Stolen Vehicles and Burglaries.  <br>
		</font> </p>
	<p><h3>Scenes</h3>
		<font size="2">
		My visualization of the data guides the viewer through a sequential set of web pages as the <br>
		vehicle for the scenes.  The landing page allows for either reading about the visualization <br>
		which brings the viewer to this page or continue on with the day of week view of the data. <br>
		The two scenes in the middle only have links that move the viewer forward.  The last scene <br>
		which invites the viewer to explore the data allows the viewer to return to the first page.<br>
		</font> </p>
	<p><h3>Annotations</h3>
		<font size="2">
		I used annotations on the first three scenes to provide the viewer with some hints about <br>
		what parts of the data might be interesting.  I chose to locate the annotations near the <br>
		data of interest.  I also chose a different color, forestgreen, to draw the viewer's <br>
		attention to the note.<br>
