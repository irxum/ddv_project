	<p><h2> About this Visualization </h2></p>
	<body>
	<p><h3>Structure</h3>
		<font size="2">
		The visualization employs the martini glass structure.  The first three scenes shows the data <br>
		aggregated by quarter, day of week and hour of day.  The last scene invites the viewer to <br>
		explore the data further.  Each of the first three scenes has stacked bar charts that displays <br>
		the data for Stolen Vehicles and Burglaries.  <br>
		</font> </p>
	<p><h3>Scenes</h3>
		<font size="2">
		My visualization employs guiding the viewer through a sequential set of web pages as the <br>
		vehicle for the scenes.  The landing page allows for either reading about the visualization <br>
		which brings the viewer to this page or continue on with the day of week view of the data. <br>
