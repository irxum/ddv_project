	<p><h2> About this Visualization </h2></p>
	<body>
	<p><h3>Structure</h3>
		<font size="2">
		The visualization employs the martini glass structure.  The first three scenes shows the data <br>
		aggregated by quarter, day of week and hour of day.  The last scene invites the viewer to <br>
		explore the data further.  Each of the first three scenes has stacked bar charts that displays <br>
		the data for Stolen Vehicles and Burglaries.  <br>
		</font> </p>
	<p><h3>Scenes</h3>
		<font size="2">
		My visualization of the data guides the viewer through a sequential set of web pages as the <br>
		vehicle for the scenes.  The landing page allows for either reading about the visualization <br>
		which brings the viewer to this page or continue on with the day of week view of the data. <br>
		The two scenes in the middle only have links that move the viewer forward.  The last scene <br>
		which invites the viewer to explore the data allows the viewer to return to the first page.<br>
		</font> </p>
	<p><h3>Annotations</h3>
		<font size="2">
		I used annotations on the first three scenes to provide the viewer with some hints about <br>
		what parts of the data might be interesting.  I chose to locate the annotations near the <br>
		data of interest.  I also chose a different color, forestgreen, to draw the viewer's <br>
		attention to the note.<br>
		</font> </p>
	<p><h3>Parameters</h3>
		<font size="2">
		The last scene, which invites data exploration, allows the viewer to choose to display either <br>
		the stolen vehicles dataset or the burglaries dataset.  I chose to enable the view to do so <br>
		by employing a pair of radio buttons.  The viewer can also select as a parameter, the quarter <br>
		of the year to display by adjusting a slider.  I added some explanation to the bottom of the <br>
		page to explain this.  
		</font> </p>
	<p><h3>Triggers</h3>
		<font size="2">
		Once the viewer updates the radio button selections, my visualization recognizes that as a <br>
		trigger to update both the day of week and hour of day charts on the data exploration page <br>
		I kept the color sequence aligned with the prior scenese.  Therefore, if the viewer selects <br>
		stolen vehicles, the bar charts are colored orange whereas if the viewer selects burglaries, <br>
		the bar charts are colored steelblue.  I chose the color scheme to allow for contrast and <br>
		they also are Illinois colors.  Once the viewer updates the slider bar, my visualization <br>
		recognizes that as a trigger to update two charts on the data exploration page to reflect the <br>
		corresponding data for the quarter of the 2017 year.  I also included a text box to show the <br>
		selected quarter.
		</font> </p>
	<p><h3>Future Work & Improvements</h3>
		<font size="2">3
		This is my first narrative visualization done with d3.  I am also a novice when it comes to <br>
		web design and html.  The visualization can stand to improve with greater use of d3 capabilities. <br>
		Also, future work might allow for the viewer to explore other years besides 2017.  Other nice <br>
		touches, I was considering, include: mouseover effects and including more charts in the data <br>
		exploration page.  Overall, it was a good learning experience for me.
